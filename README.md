# Born2beroot
This project is an exercise in system administration. It involves setting up and configuring a Debian GNU/Linux server on a virtual machine, including some scripts. <br> <br>
The virtual machine was created in VirtualBox following specific instructions. An operating system was then set up using strict rules. The operating system chosen is the latest stable version of Debian. <br><br>
The monitoring.sh script was mandatory to implement. It is written in bash and displays various information. <br> <br>
